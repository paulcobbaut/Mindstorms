Lego Mindstorms NXT and EV3 projects

### Remote controlled car (for NXT in NXC)
[car_car.nxc](https://github.com/paulcobbaut/Mindstorms/blob/master/car_car.nxc) contains code for a Mindstorms NXT car that can drive forwards, backwards and make turns. It also beeps when driving backwards. [car_remote](https://github.com/paulcobbaut/Mindstorms/blob/master/car_remote.nxc) contains code to remote control this car. This requires a second NXT brick.

### Simple NXT car with sensors
[simple_car.nxc](https://github.com/paulcobbaut/Mindstorms/blob/master/simple_car.nxc) contains code to operate two motors, the sound module and three sensors, namely sound, colour and Ultrasonic for distance measuring. The car starts when it hears a sound, it avoids obstacles with random turns and stops when it sees red (or a hand) in the colour sensor.
